        Hi there!

        We'd appreciate it if you could search on pip's existing issues prior to filing
        a bug report.

        We get a lot of duplicate tickets and have limited maintainer capacity to triage
        them. Thanks!

        Provide the output of the steps above, including the commands
        themselves and pip's output/traceback etc. If you're familiar with
        Markdown, this block will have triple backticks added automatically
        around it -- you don't have to add them.

        If you want to present output from multiple commands, please present
        that as a shell session (commands you run get prefixed with `$ `).
        Please also ensure that the "How to reproduce" section contains matching
        instructions for reproducing this.
