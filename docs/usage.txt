Usage
=====

Install packages
----------------

Once you have pip, you can use it like this::

    $ pip install SomePackage

`SomePackage` is some package you'll find on `PyPI
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/>`_.  This installs the package and all
its dependencies.

You can also install from a URL (that points to a tar or zip file),
install from some version control system (use URLs like
``hg+http://domain/repo`` -- or prefix ``git+``, ``svn+`` etc).  pip
knows a bunch of stuff about revisions and stuff, so if you need to do
things like install a very specific revision from a repository pip can
do that too.

You can use ``pip install --upgrade SomePackage`` to upgrade to a
newer version, or ``pip install SomePackage==1.0.4`` to install a very
specific version.

Edit mode
*********

Packages normally_ install under ``site-packages``, but when you're
making changes, it makes more sense to run the package straight from the
checked-out source tree. "Editable" installs create a ``.pth`` file in
``site-packages`` that extends Python's import path to find the
package::

    $ pip install -e path/to/SomePackage

.. _normally: http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#how-installation-works

Version control systems
***********************

Pip knows how to check out a package from version control. The
repository will be checked out in a temporary folder, installed, and
cleaned up::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/simplejson/simplejson.git
    $ pip install svn+svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/zope.interface/trunk/

This can be combined with the `-e` flag, and Pip will perform the
checkout in ``./src/``. You need to supply a name for the checkout
folder by appending a hash to the repository URL::

    $ pip install -e git+https://github.com/lakshmivyas/hyde.git#egg=hyde


Uninstall packages
------------------

pip is able to uninstall most installed packages with ``pip uninstall
package-name``.

Known exceptions include pure-distutils packages installed with
``python setup.py install`` (such packages leave behind no metadata allowing
determination of what files were installed), and script wrappers installed
by develop-installs (``python setup.py develop``).

pip also performs an automatic uninstall of an old version of a package
before upgrading to a newer version, so outdated files (and egg-info data)
from conflicting versions aren't left hanging around to cause trouble. The
old version of the package is automatically restored if the new version
fails to download or install.

Searching for packages
----------------------

pip can search the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ (PyPI)
for packages using the ``pip search`` command. To search, run::

    $ pip search "query"

The query will be used to search the names and summaries of all packages
indexed.

pip searches http://pypi.python.org/pypi by default but alternative indexes
can be searched by using the ``--index`` flag.

Bundles
-------

Another way to distribute a set of libraries is a bundle format (specific to
pip).  This format is not stable at this time (there simply hasn't been
any feedback, nor a great deal of thought).  A bundle file contains all the
source for your package, and you can have pip install them all together.
Once you have the bundle file further network access won't be necessary.  To
build a bundle file, do::

    $ pip bundle MyApp.pybundle MyApp

(Using a :ref:`requirements file <requirements-files>` would be wise.)  Then
someone else can get the file ``MyApp.pybundle`` and run::

    $ pip install MyApp.pybundle

This is *not* a binary format.  This only packages source.  If you have binary
packages, then the person who installs the files will have to have a compiler,
any necessary headers installed, etc.  Binary packages are hard, this is
relatively easy.
