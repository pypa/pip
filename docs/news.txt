News for pyinstall
==================

0.1.4
-----

* Added an option ``--install-option`` to pass options to pass
  arguments to ``setup.py install``

* ``.svn/`` directories are no longer included in bundles, as these
  directories are specific to a version of svn -- if you build a
  bundle on a system with svn 1.5, you can't use the checkout on a
  system with svn 1.4.  Instead a file ``svn-checkout.txt`` is
  included that notes the original location and revision, and the
  command you can use to turn it back into an svn checkout.  (Probably
  unpacking the bundle should, maybe optionally, recreate this
  information -- but that is not currently implemented, and it would
  require network access.)

* Avoid ambiguities over project name case, where for instance
  MyPackage and mypackage would be considered different packages.
  This in particular caused problems on Macs, where ``MyPackage/`` and
  ``mypackage/`` are the same directory.

* Added support for an environmental variable
  ``$PYINSTALL_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` which will cache package downloads, so
  future installations won't require large downloads.  Network access
  is still required, but just some downloads will be avoided when
  using this.

0.1.3
-----

* Always use ``svn checkout`` (not ``export``) so that
  ``tag_svn_revision`` settings give the revision of the package.

* Don't update checkouts that came from ``.pybundle`` files.

0.1.2
-----

* Improve error text when there are errors fetching HTML pages when
  seeking packages.

* Improve bundles: include empty directories, make them work with
  editable packages.

* If you use ``-E env`` and the environment ``env/`` doesn't exist, a
  new virtual environment will be created.

* Fix ``dependency_links`` for finding packages.

0.1.1
-----

* Fixed a NameError exception when running pyinstall outside of a
  virtualenv environment.

* Added HTTP proxy support (from Prabhu Ramachandran)

* Fixed use of ``hashlib.md5`` on python2.5+ (also from Prabhu
  Ramachandran)
