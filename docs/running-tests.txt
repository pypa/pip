Running the Tests
=================

System Requirements
===================

Pip uses some system tools - VCS related tools - in its tests, so you need to
intall them (Linux)::

    sudo apt-get install subversion bzr git-core mercurial

Or downloading and installing `Subversion
<http://subversion.apache.org/packages.html>`_, `Bazaar
<http://wiki.bazaar.canonical.com/Download>`_, `Git
<http://git-scm.com/download>`_ and `Mercurial
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/>`_ manually.


How To Run Tests
================

After all requirements (system and python) are installed,
just run the following command::

    $ python setup.py test



Troubleshooting
===============

Locale Warnings
---------------

There was a problem with locales configuration when running tests in a Hudson
CI Server that broke some tests. The problem was not with pip, but with
`locales` configuration. Hudson was not setting LANG environment variable
correctly, so the solution to fix it was changing default language to
en_US.UTF-8.
The following has been done in a Ubuntu Server 9.10 machine::

    $ sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8
    $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
    $ sudo update-locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8
