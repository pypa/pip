# VCS Support

pip supports installing from various version control systems (VCS).
This support requires a working executable to be available (for the version
control system being used). It is used through URL prefixes:

- Git -- `git+`
- Mercurial -- `hg+`
- Subversion -- `svn+`
- Bazaar -- `bzr+`

The general form of a VCS requirement is `ProjectName @ VCS_URL`, e.g.

```none
MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject
MyProject[extra] @ git+https:/git.example.com/MyProject
```

This is the {ref}`Direct URL <pypug:dependency-specifiers>` requirement syntax.
It is also permissible to remove `MyProject @` portion is removed and provide
a bare VCS URL.

```none
git+https://git.example.com/MyProject
```

This is a pip specific extension. This form can be used as long as pip does
not need to know the project name in advance. pip is generally able to infer
the project name except in the case of {ref}`editable-vcs-installs`. In
addition, extras cannot be requested using a bare VCS URL.

## Supported VCS

### Git

The supported schemes are `git+file`, `git+https`, `git+ssh`, `git+http`,
`git+git` and `git`. Here are some of the supported forms:

```none
MyProject @ git+ssh://git@git.example.com/MyProject
MyProject @ git+file:///home/user/projects/MyProject
MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject
```

```{warning}
The use of `git`, `git+git`, and `git+http` schemes is discouraged.
The former two use [the Git Protocol], which lacks authentication, and HTTP is
insecure due to lack of TLS based encryption.
```

[the Git Protocol]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-The-Protocols

It is also possible to specify a "git ref" such as branch name, a commit hash or
a tag name:

```none
MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject.git@master
MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject.git@v1.0
MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject.git@da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709
MyProject @ git+https://git.example.com/MyProject.git@refs/pull/123/head
```

When passing a commit hash, specifying a full hash is preferable to a partial
hash because a full hash allows pip to operate more efficiently (e.g. by
making fewer network calls).

### Mercurial

The supported schemes are `hg+file`, `hg+http`, `hg+https`, `hg+ssh`
and `hg+static-http`. Here are some of the supported forms:

```
MyProject @ hg+http://hg.myproject.org/MyProject
MyProject @ hg+https://hg.myproject.org/MyProject
MyProject @ hg+ssh://hg.myproject.org/MyProject
MyProject @ hg+file:///home/user/projects/MyProject
```

It is also possible to specify a revision number, a revision hash, a tag name
or a local branch name:

```none
MyProject @ hg+http://hg.example.com/MyProject@da39a3ee5e6b
MyProject @ hg+http://hg.example.com/MyProject@2019
MyProject @ hg+http://hg.example.com/MyProject@v1.0
MyProject @ hg+http://hg.example.com/MyProject@special_feature
```

### Subversion

The supported schemes are `svn`, `svn+svn`, `svn+http`, `svn+https` and
`svn+ssh`. Here are some of the supported forms:

```none
MyProject @ svn+https://svn.example.com/MyProject
MyProject @ svn+ssh://svn.example.com/MyProject
MyProject @ svn+ssh://user@svn.example.com/MyProject
```

You can also give specific revisions to an SVN URL, like so:

```none
-e MyProject @ svn+http://svn.example.com/svn/MyProject/trunk@2019
-e MyProject @ svn+http://svn.example.com/svn/MyProject/trunk@{20080101}
```

Note that you need to use [Editable VCS installs](#editable-vcs-installs) for
using specific revisions from Subversion.

### Bazaar

The supported schemes are `bzr+http`, `bzr+https`, `bzr+ssh`, `bzr+sftp`,
`bzr+ftp` and `bzr+lp`. Here are the supported forms:

```none
MyProject @ bzr+http://bzr.example.com/MyProject/trunk
MyProject @ bzr+sftp://user@example.com/MyProject/trunk
MyProject @ bzr+ssh://user@example.com/MyProject/trunk
MyProject @ bzr+ftp://user@example.com/MyProject/trunk
MyProject @ bzr+lp:MyProject
```

Tags or revisions can be installed like so:

```none
MyProject @ bzr+https://bzr.example.com/MyProject/trunk@2019
MyProject @ bzr+http://bzr.example.com/MyProject/trunk@v1.0
```

(editable-vcs-installs)=

## Editable VCS installs

VCS projects can be installed in {ref}`editable mode <editable-installs>` (using
the {ref}`--editable <install_--editable>` option) or not.

In editable mode, the project name must be provided upfront using the Direct URL
(`MyProject @ URL`) form so pip can determine the VCS clone location.

- The default clone location (for editable installs) is:

  - `<venv path>/src/SomeProject` in virtual environments
  - `<cwd>/src/SomeProject` for global Python installs

  The {ref}`--src <install_--src>` option can be used to modify this location.

- For non-editable installs, the project is built locally in a temp dir and then
  installed normally.

Note that if a satisfactory version of the package is already installed, the
VCS source will not overwrite it without an `--upgrade` flag. Further, pip
looks at the package version, at the target revision to determine what action to
take on the VCS requirement (not the commit itself).

## URL fragments

pip looks at the `subdirectory` fragments of VCS URLs for specifying the path to the
Python package, when it is not in the root of the VCS directory.

```{note}
pip also supports an `egg` fragment to specify the "project name". This is a legacy
feature and its use is discouraged in favour of the
{ref}`Direct URL <pypug:dependency-specifiers>` form.

The `egg` fragment **should** be a bare {ref}`project name <pypug:name-normalization>`.
Anything else is not guaranteed to work.
```

````{admonition} Example
If your repository layout is:

```
pkg_dir
├── setup.py  # setup.py for package "pkg"
└── some_module.py
other_dir
└── some_file
some_other_file
```

Then, to install from this repository, the syntax would be:

```{pip-cli}
$ pip install "pkg @ vcs+protocol://repo_url/#subdirectory=pkg_dir"
```

or:

```{pip-cli}
$ pip install -e "pkg @ vcs+protocol://repo_url/#subdirectory=pkg_dir"
```
