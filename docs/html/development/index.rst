Development
===========

pip is a volunteer maintained open source project and we welcome contributions
of all forms. The sections below will help you get started with development,
testing, and documentation.

You can also join ``#pypa`` (general packaging discussion and user support) and
``#pypa-dev`` (discussion about development of packaging tools) `on Freenode`_,
or the `distutils-sig mailing list`_, to ask questions or get involved.
