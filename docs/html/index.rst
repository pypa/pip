If you find bugs, need help, or want to talk to the developers, please use our mailing lists or chat rooms:

* `Issue tracking`_
* `Discourse channel`_
* `User IRC`_

If you want to get involved, head over to GitHub to get the source code, and feel free to jump on the developer mailing lists and chat rooms:
