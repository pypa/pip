Improved yanking behavior to properly distinguish between file-level and
release-level yanking per PEP 592:

- **File-level yanking**: When individual files are yanked but not all files
  for a version, only those specific yanked files are excluded. Other
  non-yanked files from the same version can still be selected.

- **Release-level yanking**: When all files for a version are yanked, the
  version is considered "yanked" and the pinned version exception (``==`` or
  ``===``) applies, allowing it to be installed only when explicitly pinned.
