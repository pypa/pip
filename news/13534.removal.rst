Deprecate the ``PIP_CONSTRAINT`` environment variable for specifying build
constraints.

Build constraints should now be specified using the ``--build-constraint``
option or the ``PIP_BUILD_CONSTRAINT`` environment variable. When using build
constraints, ``PIP_CONSTRAINT`` no longer affects isolated build environments.
To opt in to this behavior without specifying any build constraints, use
``--use-feature=build-constraint``.
