When using the ``importlib.metadata`` backend (the default on Python 3.11+),
``pip list`` does not show installed egg distributions more than once anymore.
Additionally, egg distributions whose parent directory was in ``sys.path`` but
the egg themselves were not in ``sys.path`` are not detected anymore.
