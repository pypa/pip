Modified to percent-encode the revision part in version control URLs.
For example, use ``git+https://example.com/repo.git@issue%231`` to specify the branch ``issue#1``.
If you previously used a branch name containing a ``%`` character in a version control URL, you now need to replace it with ``%25`` to ensure correct percent-encoding.
