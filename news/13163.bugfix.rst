The inclusion of packaging 24.2 changes how pre-release specifiers with ``<`` and ``>``
behave. Including a pre-release version with these specifiers now implies
accepting pre-releases (e.g., ``<2.0dev`` can include ``1.0rc1``). To avoid
implying pre-releases, avoid specifying them (e.g., use ``<2.0``).
The exception is ``!=``, which never implies pre-releases.
