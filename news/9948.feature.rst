Implement the ``--no-deps-for`` switch for the ``install`` command and the
requirements file. This switch will prevent the installation of dependencies of
specific packages, as opposed to the ``--no-deps`` switch which prevents the
installation dependencies of all requested packages.

Also implement recognition of the global ``--no-deps`` switch in the requirements
file.
