Add ``--http`` and ``--all`` flags to ``pip cache list`` command. By default, the command shows only locally built wheels (backward compatible). The ``--http`` flag shows only HTTP cached packages, and the ``--all`` flag shows both in a unified list with HTTP packages marked with a ``[HTTP cached]`` suffix. HTTP cached packages are extracted by inspecting wheel and tarball structures offline, displaying complete filenames with platform tags and accurate file sizes.
